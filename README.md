# Tab's Scripts
# Phoenix-911 Script

This is a simple script made by Tab which integrates with the Phoenix framework (PD Framework). What you do is /911 (message) and it sends the message to all LEO currently in the server. It doesn't send it to any civs, only Law Enforcement Officers and the Fire Department.
